**Supervised Learning: Nearest Neighbor and Range Search using LSH and HyperCube (metrics used: cosine similarity, euclidean distance)**
    * Given a set of d-diamentional vectors we train a model that finds the Nearest Neighbor and does a Range Search given a set of queries, using the approximation methos: LSH and Hypercube. Those results are then compared with their brute-force counterpart.
