# Cryptocurrency Recommendations with Machine Learning Techniques
In this project we are given the task of training a model for cryptocurrency recommendations. 

Secondly, given a set of d-diamentional vectors we train a model that finds



The project is seperated in three parts:

1. **Supervised Learning: Nearest Neighbor and Range Search using LSH and HyperCube (metrics used: cosine similarity, euclidean distance)**
    * Given a set of d-diamentional vectors we train a model that finds the Nearest Neighbor and does a Range Search given a set of queries, using the approximation methos: LSH and Hypercube. Those results are then compared with their brute-force counterpart.

1. **Unsupervised Learning: Kmeans and Kmedoid Clustering with different Initialization, Assignment and Update options. (with Silhouette)**
    * Given a set of d-diamentional vectors we train a model that finds
      * Initialization
        - Random selection
        - K-means++
      * Assignment
        - Lloyd's assignment
        - Assignment by Range Search with LSH
        - Assignment by Range Search with Hypercube
      * Update
        - K-means
        - Partitioning Around Medoids
       

1. **Cryptocurrency Recommendations using LSH Range Search and Clustering (with Cross Validation)**

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

function fancyAlert(arg) {
    if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
    }
}

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
