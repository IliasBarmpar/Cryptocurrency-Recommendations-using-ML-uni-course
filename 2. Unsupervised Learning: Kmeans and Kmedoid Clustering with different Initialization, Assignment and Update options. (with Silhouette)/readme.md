## Unsupervised Learning: Kmeans and Kmedoid Clustering with different Initialization, Assignment and Update options. (with Silhouette)

Given a set of d-diamentional vectors we train a model that finds clusters given a set of options include:
  * Initialization
    - Random selection
    - K-means++
  * Assignment
    - Lloyd's assignment
    - Assignment by Range Search with LSH
    - Assignment by Range Search with Hypercube
  * Update
    - K-means
    - Partitioning Around Medoids
